Problem 1:
- Write a simple "Hello, world!" program
- Change it as follows:
  - Add: #include <string>
  - Say: "Hello, I am Eliza. What's your name?"
  - Accept name from user - use getline(cin, name) function to read from a user. 
    You will need to create a variable of type "string" to store the name
  - Say: "What do you want me to do?"
  - Accept task from user
  -Finally say: I am sorry, <name>. I cannot do that
  
Problem 2:
- Write a program that prints out the sum and product of the first 10 (positive integer) numbers

Problem 3:
- Ask the user their name. Once you accept the name, print it out with a box around it like so:
   +------------+
   | JagBots    |
   +------------+
   Assume all names will be <=20 characters
 
 Problem 4: 
 
  Print Tux, the Linux Penguin:
    .--. 
   |o_o | 
   |:_/ | 
  //   \ \ 
 (|     | ) 
/'\_   _/`\ 
\___)=(___/ 

OR

              a8888b.   
             d888888b. 
             8P"YP"Y88

Problem 5:

Print the following limerick in a formatted table:

The skill to do math on a page
Has declined to the point of outrage.
Equations quadratica
Are solved on Math'matica,
And on birthdays we don't know our age.


Problem 6:

Print these limericks in a formatted table, wiht a line separator between them:

There once was a language named C,
Made by Thompson and Ritchie.
But it didnâ€™t take a smart aleck,
To mess up a malloc,
For everyone to segfault and flee.

Then came a language after C,
That was supposed to set us all free.
Objects were the fuss,
For this language called C++.
But it was just a fancier way to crash your PC.

Problem 8:

Write a program to print the US flag. Use * and = characters to creat the flag
